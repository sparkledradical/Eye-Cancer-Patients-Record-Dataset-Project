## 1. Dataset Overview / Size
**Question:** How many patients are in the dataset?  
**Purpose:** Understand the dataset size, which is fundamental for context.

---

## 2. Demographic Distribution
**Questions:**  
- What is the distribution of age, gender, and other demographics?  
- How many female, male, and other in the dataset?  

**Purpose:** Describe the population. Helps detect imbalances (like more males than females) which could affect analysis.

---

## 3. Disease-Specific Counts
**Question:** How many patients have each cancer type?  
**Purpose:** Understand which cancer types are most common, which informs prevalence and sampling considerations.

## 4. Survival Analysis / Outcome Exploration
**Questions:**  
- What is the average survival time for patients?  
- Which cancer type has the highest or lowest average survival time?  
- Does age affect survival time?  

**Purpose:** Explore relationships between patient features (age, cancer type) and outcomes (survival time).

---

## 5. Cross-Tab / Group Comparisons
**Questions:**  
- How does gender distribution vary across cancer types?  
- How many patients at terminal stage for each cancer type?  

**Purpose:** Examine differences across groups (cancer type, gender, stage). Helps identify patterns or disparities.
